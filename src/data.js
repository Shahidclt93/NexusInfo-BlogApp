    title: `Beastie Boys sue Chili's owner over 'Sabotage' ads`,
    des: `"Sabotage" to promote the Chili's chain without their permission.
      The group said in its complaint filed on Wednesday, opens new tab that Brinker unlawfully used "Sabotage" in Chili's social-media ads, falsely implying that the Beastie Boys endorsed the casual-dining restaurants.
      Attorneys for the Beastie Boys and spokespeople for Brinker did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the lawsuit on Thursday.
      The Beastie Boys formed in New York City in 1981 and dissolved in 2012 after founding member Adam "MCA" Yauch died of cancer. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame earlier that year.
      "Sabotage" was a single from the group's 1994 album "Ill Communication" and gained fame for its music video, a parody of 1970s television police dramas.
      The group's lawsuit said that Brinker posted Chili's ads to social media featuring "Sabotage" without a license.
      It also said that one of the ads featured "three characters wearing obvious 70s-style wigs, fake mustaches, and sunglasses" that "intended to evoke in the minds of the public scenes from Plaintiff's well-known official 'Sabotage' video."
      "The plaintiffs do not license 'Sabotage' or any of their other intellectual property for third-party product advertising purposes, and deceased Beastie Boys member Adam Yauch included a provision in his will prohibiting such uses," the lawsuit said.`,

    title: `US weekly jobless claims fall more than expected`,
    des: ` The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits dropped more than expected last week, but volatility around this time of the year as automobile manufacturers idle plants for retooling makes it harder to get a clean read on the labor market.
      Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 17,000 to a seasonally adjusted 222,000 for the week ended July 6, the lowest level since late May, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 236,000 claims in the latest week.
      The claims data included the Independence Day holiday. Claims tend to be volatile around holidays, and auto makers typically shut down assembly plants starting the July 4 week to retool for new models.
The timing can, however, vary from one manufacturer to the next, which can throw off the model that the government uses to smooth out the data for seasonal fluctuations.
While this is likely injecting noise into the claims data, signs are mounting that the labor market is losing steam as hefty interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve in 2022 and 2023 cool economic activity.`,

    title: `In Remote Canada, a College Becomes a Magnet for Indian Students`,
    desc: `On a college campus in northern Canada, eight hours by car from Toronto, most of the students who fill the classrooms are from a country half a world away: India.

      The young men and women stretching on mats in the gymnasium are more likely to be from Punjab or Gujarat, two Indian states, rather than rural Ontario. Hindi and Punjabi drowned out English in the cafeteria's lunchtime cacophony.
      
      In the surrounding city of Timmins, the waiters at two new Indian restaurants do not ask customers how spicy they want their dishes. A shuttered bar named Gibby's has been reopened as a Sikh temple, or gurdwara, where students from the school, Northern College, gathered on a recent evening.
      
      “We feel like we are in India,” said Mehardeep Singh, 20, a general arts and science major, who led a prayer. “In every class, there are only three or four local people. The rest are from India.”
      
      Northern College traditionally drew its students from the province of Ontario's vast, sparsely populated hinterland, a region dominated by miners and loggers. Today, a whopping 82 percent of the public college's students come from abroad — nearly all from India.`,

    title: `'You Can Hear a Pin Drop': The Rise of Super Strict Schools in England`,
    desc: `“Three. Two. One,” the teacher said. Pens across the room went down and all eyes shot back to the teacher. Under a policy called “Slant” (Sit up, Lean forward, Ask and answer questions, Nod your head and Track the speaker), the students, aged 11 and 12, were barred from looking away.

      When a digital bell beeped (traditional clocks are “not precise enough,” the principal said) the students walked quickly and silently to the cafeteria in a single line. There they yelled a poem — “Ozymandias,” by Percy Bysshe Shelley — in unison, then ate for 13 minutes as they discussed that day's mandatory lunch topic: how to survive a superintelligent killer snail.
      In the decade since the Michaela Community School opened in northwest London, the publicly funded but independently run secondary school has emerged as a leader of a movement convinced that children from disadvantaged backgrounds need strict discipline, rote learning and controlled environments to succeed.

“How do those who come from poor backgrounds make a success of their lives? Well, they have to work harder,” said the principal, Katharine Birbalsingh, who has a cardboard cutout of Russell Crowe in “Gladiator” in her office with the quote, “Hold the Line.” In her social media profiles, she proclaims herself “Britain's Strictest Headmistress.”`,

    title: `Mary Magdalene: Raphael's Forgotten Masterpiece Valued at 300 Million Euros`,
    desc: `Today marks the end of the exhibition of Raphael's forgotten masterpiece, “Mary Magdalene,” organized by the Department of Var with support from the Ministry of Culture. Exhibited since April 20 in the Sacristy of the Basilica of Sainte-Marie-Madeleine in Saint-Maximin-la-Sainte-Baume, the third most significant tomb in Christianity after those in Jerusalem and Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome, where Mary Magdalene's tomb is located. Mary Magdalene is considered the apostle to the apostles of Christ.
      More than 80,000 visitors from all over the world came to admire this highly secured masterpiece, which generated incredible enthusiasm. This number represents four times the population of this town in Var, located 15 minutes from the main residence of actor George Clooney.
      Admission was 3 euros, benefiting the Basilica. The owners aimed to help restore this magnificent 13th-century Gothic monument and share the work with the public. The emotional impact was profound, with the portrait's finesse and incredible gentleness. People have described the painting as “More beautiful than the Mona Lisa… The Mona Lisa of Raphael.” The public was deeply moved by its grace and beauty.`,

    desc: `In an interview with the The Hollywood Reporter, the actress talked about her 2001 stroke which resulted in a life-threatening brain bleed for nine days and a lengthy recovery.

      “Everything changed,” Stone said. “My sense of smell, my sight, my touch. I couldn't read for a couple of years. Things were stretched and I was seeing color patterns. A lot of people thought I was going to die.”
      
      Stone said it took her seven years to recover and “people took advantage of me over that time.”
      
      “I had $18 million saved because of all my success, but when I got back into my bank account, it was all gone,” the “Basic Instinct” star recalled. “My refrigerator, my phone — everything was in other people's names.”
      
      And while Stone said she had “zero money,” she also said she “decided to stay present and let go.”
      
      “I decided not to hang onto being sick or to any bitterness or anger. If you bite into the seed of bitterness, it never leaves you,” she said. “But if you hold faith, even if that faith is the size of a mustard seed, you will survive. So, I live for joy now. I live for purpose.”`,

    title: `Ellen DeGeneres is 'done' after her Netflix special`,
    desc: `The former daytime talk show host let that be known during a recent standup show at the Luther Burbank Center for the Arts in Santa Rosa, California, according to SFGate.com.

      DeGeneres let the audience in on what she's been doing since “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” ended two years ago.
      Let me catch you up on what's been going on with me since you last saw me,” she said. “I got chickens. Oh yeah, and I got kicked out of show business for being mean.”

Her talk show ended two years after a controversy involving former staff members, who alleged the environment on her talk show staff was toxic.

DeGeneres issued an apology to her staff in July 2020.

“On day one of our show, I told everyone in our first meeting that 'The Ellen DeGeneres Show' would be a place of happiness ' no one would ever raise their voice, and everyone would be treated with respect,” DeGeneres said at the time. “Obviously, something changed, and I am disappointed to learn that this has not been the case. And for that, I am sorry. Anyone who knows me knows it's the opposite of what I believe and what I hoped for our show.”

During her appearance in Santa Rosa, she “admitted to being harsh and said she was a very immature boss,” SFGate.com reported.

“I used to say, 'I don't care what people say about me,'” DeGeneres reportedly said. “Now I realize I said that during the height of my popularity.”

When an attendee asked if DeGeneres might be considering doing movies or Broadway, her response was not encouraging to her fans.

“This is the last time you're going to see me,” she said. “After my Netflix special, I'm done.”

    title: `Tech sector is a casualty of America's broken venture capital system `,
    desc: `After obtaining his economics PhD from Yale University in 1979, David Swensen was hired by Wall Street investment bank Salomon Brothers and, three years later, moved to Lehman Brothers. Three years after that, at the age of 31, he took an 80% pay cut and returned to Yale to manage the university’s endowment.

      Swensen later explained that he had accepted the job and pay cut because, “There are a lot of important things in life you don't measure in dollars and cents.” For Swensen, some of these things were teaching college students, playing poker with Nobel laureate James Tobin, being on a summer softball team with Yale's then-president, Rick Levin, watching Yale hockey games, and coaching his children's baseball and soccer teams.
      
      When Swensen took over Yale's endowment portfolio, it had a 62% allocation to U.S. stocks, 6% to developed stocks, and the rest mostly fixed income. When Swensen died in 2021, U.S. stocks were just 2% of the Yale portfolio, replaced by venture capital, leveraged buyouts, hedge funds and the like. Swensen's track record was impressive and many other endowments now emulate the “Yale Model.”

      . One explanation is that there are not enough low-hanging fruit. For example, when the demand for venture capital investments is modest, investors can be picky, but when the demand for venture capital investments far exceeds the supply of good ideas, many investors will be stuck with schemes that should never have been funded.
      
      The consequences of dubious schemes were particularly evident in fiscal 2023, when Yale, Harvard University and many other prominent endowments lost money on their venture capital and private equity investments and their portfolios were trounced by the S&P 500

    desc: `We are raising our year-end target for the S&P 500 to 5,800 from 5,400. We are still targeting 8,000 by the end of the decade. The stock market seems to be discounting our “Roaring 2020s” scenario faster than we expected. We've been among the most bullish investment strategists since November 2022 — but not bullish enough. The bull market might continue to achieve our targets ahead of schedule.

      Since June, the stock market has been in a slow-motion meltup. Economic indicators have been weaker than expected, raising the odds of Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts. The federal-funds rate futures market is signaling four 25-basis-point rate cuts over the next 12 months. Fed Chair Jerome Powell's congressional testimony this week suggests that the central bank is likely to start cutting in September.`,
